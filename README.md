# Florence Chatbot

This Node.js app demonstrates the Conversation service in a simple chat interface simulating a Flower Shop. 
A Live version can be checked out [here](http://florencechatbot.eu-gb.mybluemix.net/)

## Before you begin

* Create a Bluemix account
    * [Sign up](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/?target=/catalog/%3fcategory=watson) in Bluemix, or use an existing account. Your account must have available space for at least 1 app and 1 service.
* Make sure that you have the following prerequisites installed:
    * The [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/#download) runtime, including the [npm][npm_link] package manager
    * The [Cloud Foundry][cloud_foundry] command-line client

      Note: Ensure that you Cloud Foundry version is up to date

## Installing locally

If you want to modify the app or use it as a basis for building your own app, install it locally. You can then deploy your modified version of the app to the Bluemix cloud.

### Getting the files

Use GitHub to clone the repository locally, or [download the .zip file](https://github.com/arpitjainds/Florence-Chatbot/archive/master.zip) of the repository and extract the files.

### Setting the Proxy environment variables

Use the following Commands if you are on the proxy network.

[Set variables here](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/http-proxy.html)

### Setting up the Conversation service

You can use an exisiting instance of the Conversation service. Otherwise, follow these steps.

1. At the command line, go to the local project directory (`Florence-Chatbot`).

1. Connect to Bluemix with the Cloud Foundry command-line tool. Use one of these regions - eu-gb,ng,eu-de,su-syd,us-east
    ```bash
    cf login -a https://api.eu-gb.bluemix.net
    ```
    
1. Create an instance of the Conversation service in Bluemix.(If you already have an instance, don't follow this step) For example:

    ```bash
    cf create-service conversation free my-conversation-service
    ```

### Importing the Conversation workspace

1. In your browser, navigate to [your Bluemix console] (https://console.ng.bluemix.net/dashboard/services).

1. From the **All Items** tab, click the newly created Conversation service in the **Services** list.

1. On the Service Details page, click **Launch tool**.

1. Click the **Import workspace** icon in the Conversation service tool. Specify the location of the workspace JSON file in your local copy of the app project:

    `<project_root>/training/Florence-Chatbot.json`

1. Select **Everything (Intents, Entities, and Dialog)** and then click **Import**. The car dashboard workspace is created.

### Configuring the app environment

1. Copy or rename the `envexample.env` file to `.env` (nothing before the dot). If windows is preventing renaming the file follow [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5004633/how-to-manually-create-a-file-with-a-dot-prefix-in-windows-for-example-htacce).

1. Create a service key in the format `cf create-service-key <service_instance> <service_key>`. For example:

    ```bash
    cf create-service-key my-conversation-service myKey
    ```

1. Retrieve the credentials from the service key using the command `cf service-key <service_instance> <service_key>`. For example:

    ```bash
    cf service-key my-conversation-service myKey
    ```

   The output from this command is a JSON object, as in this example:

    ```JSON
    {
      "password": "87iT7aqpvU7l",
      "url": "https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/conversation/api",
      "username": "ca2905e6-7b5d-4408-9192-e4d54d83e604"
    }
    ```

1. Paste  the `password` and `username` values (without quotation marks) from the JSON into the `CONVERSATION_PASSWORD` and `CONVERSATION_USERNAME` variables in the `.env` file. For example:

    ```
    CONVERSATION_USERNAME=ca2905e6-7b5d-4408-9192-e4d54d83e604
    CONVERSATION_PASSWORD=87iT7aqpvU7l
    ```

1. In your Bluemix console, open the Conversation service instance where you imported the workspace.

1. Click the menu icon in the upper-right corner of the workspace tile, and then select **View details**.

    ![Screen capture of workspace tile menu](readme_images/workspace_details.png)

1. Click the ![Copy](readme_images/copy_icon.png) icon to copy the workspace ID to the clipboard.

1. On the local system, paste the workspace ID into the WORKSPACE_ID variable in the `.env` file. Save and close the file.

### Installing and starting the app

1. Install the demo app package into the local Node.js runtime environment:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

1. Start the app:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

1. Point your browser to http://localhost:3000 to try out the app.

## Testing the app

After your app is installed and running, experiment with it to see how it responds.

The chat interface is on the left, and the JSON that the JavaScript code receives from the Conversation service is on the right. Your questions and commands are interpreted using a small set of sample data trained with the following intents:

    buy flowers for some occasion
    buy flowers for someone
    suggest flowers
    buy flowers
    greetings
    goodbyes

Type a request, such as `buy flowers` or `I want buy some flowers for anniversary`. The system understands your intent and responds. You can see the details of how your input was understood by examining the JSON data in the `Watson understands` section on the right side.

For more information about intents, see the [Conversation service documentation][doc_intents].

To see details of how these intents are defined, including sample input for each intent, launch the Conversation tool.

## Modifying the app

After you have the app deployed and running, you can explore the source files and make changes. Try the following:

* Modify the .js files to change the app logic.
* Modify the .html file to change the appearance of the app page.
* Use the Conversation tool to train the service for new intents, or to modify the dialog flow. For more information, see the [Conversation service documentation][docs_landing].

## Deploying to Bluemix

You can use Cloud Foundry to deploy your local version of the app to Bluemix.

1. In the project root directory, open the `manifest.yml` file:

  * In the `applications` section of the `manifest.yml` file, change the `name` value to a unique name for your version of the demo app.
  * In the `services` section, specify the name of the Conversation service instance you created for the demo app. If you do not remember the service name, use the `cf services` command to list all services you have created.

  The following example shows a modified `manifest.yml` file:

  ```yml
  ---
  declared-services:
   conversation-service:
     label: conversation
     plan: free
  applications:
  - name: conversation-simple-app-test1
   command: npm start
   path: .
   memory: 256M
   instances: 1
   services:
   - my-conversation-service
   env:
     NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION: false
  ```

1. Push the app to Bluemix:

  ```bash
  cf push
  ```
  Access your app on Bluemix at the URL specified in the command output.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter a problem, you can check the logs for more information. To see the logs, run the `cf logs` command:

```none
cf logs <application-name> --recent
```
